            Abstract: We revisit the phenomenon of neural collapse under the case where the embedding
            dimension cannot support a simplex ETF for all the classes, but the classes have a hierarchy
            which aid a different kind of geometry in which the embeddings concentrate. Our result shows
            that the average of embeddings from the same super class (called super-class means) form a
            simplex ETF, furthermore, the sub-class mean embeddings from the same super-class, form
            another simplex ETF in the plane orthogonal to the origin super-class mean.

        <h2 class="section-title">Universal Dynamic Regret and Constraint Violation Bounds for Constrained Online Convex Optimization</h2>
        <p><em>Subhamon Supantha, A. Sinha</em></p>

            Abstract: We consider a generalization of the celebrated Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework with
            online adversarial constraints. We present two algorithms having simple modular structures that
            yield universal dynamic regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds, improving upon the
            state-of-the-art results. Our results hold in the most general case when both the cost and constraint
            functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, and the constraint functions need not contain any
            common feasible point. The results are established by reducing the constrained learning problem to
            an instance of the standard OCO problem with specially constructed surrogate cost functions.

            Abstract: We study a generalization of the Online Con-
            vex Optimization (OCO) framework with time-
            varying adversarial constraints. In this problem,
            after selecting a feasible action from the con-
            vex decision set X, a convex constraint function
            is revealed alongside the cost function in each
            round. Our goal is to design a computationally
            efficient learning policy that achieves a small re-
            gret with respect to the cost functions and a small
            cumulative constraint violation (CCV) with re-
            spect to the constraint functions over a horizon
            of length T. It is well-known that the projection
            step constitutes the major computational bottle-
            neck of the standard OCO algorithms. However,
            for many structured decision sets, linear func-
            tions can be efficiently optimized over the deci-
            sion set. We propose a projection-free online pol-
            icy which makes a single call to a Linear Program
            (LP) solver per round. Our method outperforms
            state-of-the-art projection-free online algorithms
            with adversarial constraints, achieving improved
            bounds of ˜O(T³⁄⁴) for both regret and CCV. The
            proposed algorithm is conceptually simple - it
            first constructs a surrogate cost function as a non-
            negative linear combination of the cost and con-
            straint functions. Then, it passes the surrogate
            costs to a new, adaptive version of the online con-
            ditional gradient subroutine, which we propose
            in this paper.

        <h2 class="section-title">A Dynamic Agent Based Model of the Real Economy with Monopolistic Competition, Perfect Product Differentiation, Heterogeneous Agents, Increasing Returns to Scale and Trade in Disequilibrium</h2>
        <p><em>Subhamon Supantha, N. K. Sharma</em></p>
        <p><strong>Work done at University of Hyderabad</strong></p>
        <p>
            Abstract: We have used agent-based modeling as our numerical method to artificially simu-
            late a dynamic real economy where agents are rational maximizers of an objective
            function of Cobb-Douglas type. The economy is characterised by heterogeneous
            agents, acting out of local or imperfect information, monopolistic competition,
            perfect product differentiation, allowance for increasing returns to scale tech-
            nology and trade in disequilibrium. An algorithm for economic activity in each
            period is devised and a general purpose open source agent-based model is devel-
            oped which allows for counterfactual inquiries, testing out treatments, analysing
            causality of various economic processes, outcomes and studying emergent prop-
            erties. 10,000 simulations, with 10 firms and 80 consumers are run with varying
            parameters and the results show that from only a few initial conditions the econ-
            omy reaches equilibrium while in most of the other cases it remains in perpetual
            disequilibrium. It also shows that from a few initial conditions the economy
            reaches a disaster where all the consumer wealth falls to zero or only a single pro-
            ducer remains. Furthermore, from some initial conditions, an ideal economy with
            high wage rate, high consumer utility and no unemployment is also reached. It was also observed that starting from an equal endowment of wealth in consumers
            and in producers, inequality emerged in the economy. In majority of the cases
            most of the firms(6-7) shut down because they were not profitable enough and
            only a few firms remained. Our results highlight that all these varying outcomes
            are possible for a decentralized market economy with rational optimizing agents.
